WCDAPI
---------------
This is a basic PowerShell v3 script to connect to and use the WCD API.
The only requirements are that you have PowerShell v3 installed and that you enter your username/password where it says [Your Username]/[Your Password].
The only thing it will do by default is print a list of the first page of threads in the Library forum.
