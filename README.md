WCDAPI
---------------
This is a basic PowerShell v3 script to connect to and use the WCD API.
The only requirements are that you have PowerShell v3 installed and that you enter your password where it says [Your Password].
The only thing it will do by default is print a list of the first page of threads in the Library forum.
